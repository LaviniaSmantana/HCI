        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            We designed a smart personal assistant which makes use of natural means of interaction (gestural, pseudo-haptic, traditional: mouse and keyboard) in order to control certain home appliances such as Ovens, vacuum cleaners, microwaves, thermostats and others. We created interactive designs for the following pages: Main Page, Oven, Vacuum cleaner and Washing Machine. The status of each controlled appliance can be viewed/changed via a smart device (phone, desktop, smart watch).

    <section class="main-page">
        <h2>Main Page</h2>

        <p>
            In the Main Page the user is a greeted with a welcoming message. In the tab bar the users can choose to go to their account, notifications or settings. The users can also see in the main page what appliances they can manage through the application and they can also choose to add a new device or delete one that's already connected.

        <h2>Vacuum Cleaner</h2>

        <p>
            In the Vacuum Cleaner page the users can turn on and off the vacuum, check the vacuum's battery and the vacuum's power level that is set through Augmented Reality (demonstration in video made with Adobe Aero). They can also pause the cleaning program.

            In the Washing Machine page the users can turn on and off the machine and choose a washing program, where they can also see how long the cycle is and the temperature used in the program.

            In the Oven page the users can turn on and off the oven and check the oven's temperature and baking time. The users also have the options to preheat, bake and start the self-cleaning program.

        <h1>User Flow</h1>

        <p>
            For our gestural remote control project we chose a design that makes navigating the application easy to understand and follow. We included clear labels, icons to guide the users through different sections while also maintaining consistency throughout the app. <br> <br>
            We also decided to minimize the number of steps required to complete a certain task. To enhance usability we chose to group different related action; for example: Preheat, Bake, Self-cleaning buttons, the tab bar or the washing programs buttons.<br> <br>
            We maintain a clean look by creating a different page for each appliance in order to avoid overwhelming the users with too many options on a single screen. <br><br>
            Below we created a diagram that shows the user flow of the application:

    <div class="emotions">
        <h1> Affective factors and emotions</h1>
        <p>
            In order to improve the users' experience we took into consideration a few affective factors and emotions:
            <h3>Convenience</h3>
            <li>This app gives the users an easy way to control and manage their home appliances through a few buttons and intuitive gestures. This way, the users may feel a sense of satisfaction and joy.</li>
            <h3>Reliability</h3>
            <li>Our app engages with Augmented Reality (e.g. they can set the power level of the oven through AR) by just swiping up and down or tapping a button in the air. After that, you can see these actions in the app which proves the users that it's accurate and credible. </li>
            <h3>Empowerment and control</h3>
            <li>Allowing users to have complete control over their home through a single application can make them feel empowered and satisfied when they successfully navigate it.</li>

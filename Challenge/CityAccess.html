            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>  Users:</b> The primary users of the canteen application would be students, and possibly faculty members as well. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>   Location:</b> The application would be used in a canteen the environment or at home.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>   Time of use: </b>The application would likely be used during busy periods, such as lunchtime or between classes, when the canteen is crowded and there may be a rush to order and pay for food quickly. The application needs to be a fast and efficient service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>   Device: </b>The application would be accessed on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>   Tasks: </b>The primary tasks of the canteen application would be to browse the menu, place orders, pay for purchases, and possibly provide feedback or ratings.

          <h3>
            Main audience
          </h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
           <b> Students:</b> The primary audience for the canteen application are students who are attending the school or university where the canteen is located. It's important to consider the needs and preferences of this audience, such as their dietary requirements, budget, and taste preferences. The application should be user-friendly, visually appealing, and provide relevant information that students need to make informed choices about their food purchases.
          </li>
            <li>
              <b> Faculty and Staff: </b>While students may be the primary audience, it's also important to consider the needs of faculty and staff who may use the application as well. This audience may have different dietary requirements and preferences, and may use the application during different times of the day. The application should be designed to accommodate these needs, while still prioritizing the needs of the primary audience.
          </li>
            <li>
              <b> Administrators: </b>Administrators may also be considered an audience for the canteen application, as they may need to access data or analytics related to food purchases and user behavior. The application should provide relevant data and insights in a clear and easy-to-understand format.
          </li>
            <li>
              <b> Vendors: </b>The vendors who supply food and beverages to the canteen may also be considered an audience for the application. The application should provide an easy and efficient way for vendors to manage their inventory, update menus, and receive orders from users.

      <h2>Using metaphors/idioms, affordances and visual variables</h2>

      <h3>1. Metaphors</h3>
      <p>
        Metaphoric design depends on a user's understanding of references from the physical world to denote the function of interface controls. Visual metaphors are 2D representations of 3D objects from the physical world used to communicate the purpose of an interface control. 
      </p>
        <p> Several metaphors for the UAIC Canteen application that could potentially be implemented: </p>
        <li> Home icon : the starting page </li>
        <li> Shopping cart icon : a page that allows users to view the products they added to the cart.</li>
        <li>Phone icon : redirects the user to the Canteen's contacts.</li>
        <li> Plate and cutlery icon: redirects the user to the Canteen's menu/catalog. </li>
        
        <p>Icons used to filter food categories:</p>
        <li> Snowflake icon: used for cold served foods.</li>
        <li> Steaming bowl icon: used for hot served foods.</li>
        <li> Hot pepper icon: used for spicy foods (the number of peppers represents the foods' spiciness level).</li>
     

      <h3>2. Idioms</h3>
      <p>
        Idioms have also been used since the beginning of direct manipulation user interfaces and continue to be widely used today. Well defined idioms effectively communicate their purpose through usage. An idiom can fail if it's purpose is not clear through affordance and its functionality is not memorable to the user. An effective idiom should require one usage to be remembered and understood.
      </p>

      <p>One idiom we added is a history icon for the previous orders.</p>

      Affordances are used in UI and UX to help users figure out what to do without having to use pictures, labels, or instructions.  The likelihood of a user pushing a button is the button's affordance. <br>
      Affordances provide useful visual cues and psychological shortcuts that help users understand the tasks that they can carry out on a website or within an app. When used well, affordances make your designs intuitive and easy to use, which increases conversions. 
      <br>Designing with good affordance is all about minimizing user error. Interactive elements should stand out and important functions should be obvious.</p>

      <p>Affordance in action: 
      <li> coloring the Shopping cart icon when this tab is active.</li>
      <div class="tab-bar">
        <img src="poze/tab-bar.png" width="250" height="50">
      </div>
      <li> Adding a red button showing the number of new notifications.</li>
      <div class="tab-bar">

      <h3>4. Visual variables</h3>
      <h4>Gestalt Principles</h4>
      <p>
 
        <li>Law of Pragnanz: This is the fundamental principle of gestalt. We prefer things that are simple, clear and ordered. Instinctually these things are safer. They take less time for us to process and present less dangerous surprises. On our application we decided to use simple colors and fonts.</li>
        
        <li>Common regions: Another way to show a connection between elements is to enclose them in some way. Everything inside the enclosure is seen as related. Everything outside the encloser is seen as separate. On our single item page, the user can see Everything related to the product (description, price, portion size) in a single box. </li>
        
        <li>Proximity : it is similar to common regions but uses space as the enclosure. When elements are positioned close to one another, they are seen as part of a group rather than as individual elements. This is especially true when the elements in the group are closer to each other than they are to any elements outside the group. For example, the History page shows multiple previous orders.</li>
        
        <li>Past experience: is unique to the individual, so it's difficult to make assumptions about how it will be perceived. However, there are common experiences we all share. For example, a lot of color meaning arises out of past experience.
        Having seen traffic lights throughout our lives, we expect red to mean stop and green to mean go. You probably see the image above as a traffic light on its side, because of the three common colors. This is why we decided to show the Canteen's traffic using a green, yellow or red circle.</li>

      <h2>Discussing better solutions for the UAIC Canteen on-site location</h2>

      <p>
        During our trips to the UAIC Canteen we have noticed some problems with the layout. <br>
        Some solutions:
        <li> Building walker stairs (handicap stairs) or adding an elevator to help people who utilize walkers, canes or wheelchairs.</li>
        <li> Adding signs or arrows on the floor in order to indicate the way for going down and up the stairs.</li>
        <li> Adding sign for the kitchen area. </li>
        <li> Using a lane marking tape to define the area for ordering/picking up the food.</li>
        </p>
      <h2>Software solution for improvement</h2>

      <p>
        Currently, the UAIC "Titu Maiorescu" Canteen doesn't have a proper website. The only way to access it is by entering the <a
        href="https://www.uaic.ro/meniul-zilei-la-cantinele-universitatii/">University Website</a> where we can view and download today's menu and check the working hours. </p>

        <p>Below you can find multiple pages of our application so you can see what solutions we envisioned.</p>

        <li> Main screen: <br>
          On the main screen the users will be able to check the current traffic (meaning how busy the Canteen is at the moment). We also added an image slider of the 3 most recommended foods from today's menu. Below that the user can find the Canteen's Contact information (phone number, email address, address). The tab bar from the bottom consists of: Menu, Home (active page), Notifications, Shopping Cart. 
        </li>
        <li> Menu: <br>
            The menu displays the categories of food and beverages that the Canteen offers. The users have the option to filter these based on how they are served (hot or cold).
        </li>
        <li> Single item page: <br>
            The users will be able to see an image of the item as well as a small description. We will also add hot-pepper icons to indicate the spiciness level of the item. 
        </li>
        <li> Shopping cart: <br>
            The users will see the products from their carts and the total price. They can either delete an item or add more. Below that they will be able to process the order. 
        </li>
        <li> User Account: <br>
            The users have the option to update their name, picture, phone number, email, address or credit card info.
        </li> 
        <li> History: <br>
            Here the users can check their previous orders and also view how many points they have. Every time they order from the Canteen they will get back 10% of the money they spent in points. When they reach a certain number of points they will be able to get something for free.

        <div class="empiric-laws">
            <h2>Empiric Laws</h2>
    
            <h3>1. Fitts' Law</h3>
            <p>
                The implications of Fitts' law can be grouped into 2 distinct categories, corresponding to the two variables that affect the movement time: target size and distance to target. <br>
            
                The most obvious implication of Fitts' law is: make targets big. People will click, tap, or hover faster on larger targets, according to this law. Additionally, as target sizes increase, error rates decrease. Guidelines for target size are usually created by determining the rate of error for various target sizes and identifying the size at which the error rate levels off. <br>
                
                Another implication in Fitts' Law that we added to our Canteen Application consists of screen edge implementation. The screen edges act as natural walls for the cursor — as soon as the pointer reaches an edge, it cannot move beyond it, regardless of the speed with which that wall has been hit. <br>
                This placement optimizes movement time to this frequently accessed area, as the options in the menu become infinite targets and users will not need to slow down in order to hit them accurately.
            </p>
    
            <h3>2. Hick's Law</h3>
            <p>
                Hick's Law predicts that the time and the effort it takes to make a decision, increases with the number of options. It also describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically. <br>

                A practical use applied is keeping the number of options in the tab bar small: Menu, Home, Notifications and Shopping Cart.<br>
                
                Hick's law can be used to narrow down big volumes of information without overloading the user.
                In order to simplify complex processes, we tried to present on the screen specific parts of that process one at a time. For example, when you enter the Menu page you will only see the categories (soup, drinks etc.) and only after clicking on one category you will be directed to another page that contains all the items from that specific category. <br>

                For our application we decided to reduce distractions (like having more choices). This way we highlighted the important options of the app (to view/order food from the Canteen) to avoid slow response time.

            </p>
    
            <h3>3. Steering</h3>
            <p>
                The Steering Law predicts the time necessary to steer a pointer (such as a mouse cursor) through a bounded tunnel (such as a menu, a scroll bar, or slider). The steering time depends on the length and the width of the tunnel: the longer and the narrower the tunnel, the more time will be required to successfully steer through it. <br>

                For our application we didn't use a dropdown menu, but instead we used a tab bar.
                
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="affordances">
            <h2>Affordances</h2>

            <p>
              Metaphorical affordances rely on imagery of real or original objects to convey purpose (shopping cart to indicate your online purchases). <br>
 
            Notifications are used to draw the user's attention to something or to indicate a change. Notifications should be obvious enough to notice, but not too distracting (for example, a red dot on top of the notification icon). <br>
 
            Input fields indicate that a user can enter data (search bar). These are often conveyed by the shape of the field and the contrast between the field and it's background.  <br>
 
            Similar to icons, photos are quick visual cues that help users understand what they can do with a product. For instance, our application has a slideshow with pictures of different meals that the Canteen provides.

          <li>Alexandru worked on the first 2 points from our City Accessibility project which include creating the Personas and also explaining the context of use and main audience.</li>
          <li>Deborah highlighted the Canteen's on-site location problems and suggested better solutions. She also created a design for the pages: Menu, Shopping Cart, Main page and History page. She also contributed to discussing about metaphors/idioms, affordances, Empiric Laws.</li>
          <li>Lavinia added all the information in this HTML document describing our team's approach. She also created a design for the pages: Single item and User Account and she made the User Flow Diagram.</li>
